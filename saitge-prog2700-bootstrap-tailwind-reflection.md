## **Lab 1 Reflection Summary – Bootstrap Header Workshop**

**What students learned**

* Bootstrap enables **rapid UI construction** using prebuilt components.
* Responsive navigation (including mobile collapse) works **with minimal setup**.
* Consistent spacing, alignment, and layout are achieved **without writing custom CSS**.

**What worked well**

* The navbar component provided **immediate structure**.
* Built-in JavaScript behavior (collapse, toggler) reduced complexity.
* Students could focus on **content and layout**, not low-level CSS rules.

**Challenges encountered**

* Limited control over fine-grained styling without overrides.
* Customizing beyond the default Bootstrap “look” can require extra effort.
* Some students relied on components without fully understanding underlying CSS.

**Key takeaway**

> Bootstrap is ideal when you need **fast, standardized, and reliable UI components**, especially for common patterns like navigation.

## **Lab 2 Reflection Summary – Tailwind Header Workshop**

**What students learned**

* Tailwind uses **utility-first classes** to describe layout and styling directly.
* Responsive behavior is **explicit and visible** in the HTML.
* Styling decisions require more intention, but offer **greater design control**.

**What worked well**

* Precise control over spacing, typography, and color.
* Easier alignment with a **custom design system** (like Corah branding).
* Students gained a stronger understanding of how layout and responsiveness work.

**Challenges encountered**

* Initial discomfort with many utility classes.
* Mobile menu behavior required **manual JavaScript**, increasing responsibility.
* More thinking up front compared to Bootstrap’s “plug-and-play” components.

**Key takeaway**

> Tailwind is ideal when **design consistency, customization, and long-term maintainability** matter more than speed.

## **Comparative Reflection (Lab 1 vs Lab 2)**

| Aspect                | Bootstrap        | Tailwind       |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Speed to first result | Faster           | Slower         |
| Design control        | Moderate         | High           |
| Built-in behavior     | Yes              | No (manual JS) |
| Learning depth        | Shallow → Medium | Medium → Deep  |
| Fit for Corah         | Good             | Excellent      |

**Overall insight**

> Bootstrap helped students *build quickly*.
> Tailwind helped students *understand deeply*.

## **Program-Level Reflection (Why Both Matter)**

By completing **both labs**, students:

* Experienced **two professional workflows**
* Learned to **evaluate tools instead of memorizing them**
* Developed confidence choosing the **right framework for the right project**

This aligns directly with **NSCC’s applied, decision-based learning model** and prepares students for real-world front-end work.
